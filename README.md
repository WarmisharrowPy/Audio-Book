**I prefer to use Pycharm IDE**

**Installation**

**For windows users**

(run those in command prompt/cmt/terminal) To speak out, or text to speech `pip install pyttsx3`

To read PDF `pip install  PyPDF2`

**For linux users**

Learn all the above commands on terminal. Make sure to use `pip3`, because in linux `pip` refers for python2 and `pip3` refers to python3. Install these too - `pip3 install pyttsx3` and `pip install  PyPDF2`
